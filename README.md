# Data Science Projects 

A home for links to some of my data science-adjacent work, and smaller notebooks that aren't (yet) worthy of their own repo. 

## Python 
- [Personal eBird Stats](https://github.com/abigailstone/data-viz/blob/main/eBird-Stats.ipynb) - A notebook for processing an export of personal user data from eBird and displaying some interesting information about an individual birder's habits and species records.

## R 

- [Optimal Big Day](https://github.com/abigailstone/optimal-big-day) - A web app for birders to determine the birding route with the highest likelihood of seeing the most birds, based on data from eBird. Shiny App [here](https://aves.shinyapps.io/optimalBigDay/).
- [Counting Birds](https://github.com/abigailstone/countingbirds) - Data Science class final project (Fall 2020). Exploring patterns in how people report large numbers of birds to eBird. Shiny App [here](https://abigailstone.shinyapps.io/birdcounts/).

## JavaScript  

- [GLX Access](https://github.com/abigailstone/glx-access) - A Google Earth Engine project to show the difference in average walking time from various neighborhoods in Somerville, Medford, and Cambridge to a MBTA station before and after the opening of the Green Line Extension. GEE App [here](https://astone.users.earthengine.app/view/glx-service).
- [Lake Ice Extent](https://github.com/abigailstone/champlain-ice) - A Google Earth Engine project that uses C-band SAR imagery to predict and display lake ice extent on Vermont's Lake Champlain. GEE app [here](https://astone.users.earthengine.app/view/champlain-ice).
